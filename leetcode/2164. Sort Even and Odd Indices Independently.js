//2164. Sort Even and Odd Indices Independently
/*
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. Rearrange the values of nums according to the following rules:

Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.
Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.
