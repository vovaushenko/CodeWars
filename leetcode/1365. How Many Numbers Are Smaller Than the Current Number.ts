// 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

// Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

// Return the answer in an array.

const smallerNumbersThanCurrent = (nums: number[]): number[] =>
  nums.map((number) => nums.filter((n) => n < number).length);
